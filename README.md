## Introduction

The introduction section provides an overview of the purpose of this repository and the technologies used.

## Configure Dataset, Hyperparameters, and Evaluation Metrics

In this section, we configure the dataset, set up the model hyperparameters, and define the evaluation metrics for the training process.

## Train Model

The train model section covers the steps involved in training the review classifier using BERT and SageMaker. It includes setting up the PyTorch script, launching the training job, and analyzing the training metrics.

## Analyze Debugger Results

In the analyze debugger results section, we explore the output data from the SageMaker Debugger to gain insights into the training process and identify any issues or optimizations.

## Download SageMaker Debugger Profiling Report

Here, we learn how to download and review the profiling report generated by the SageMaker Debugger. The report provides information about system and framework metrics collected during the training job.

## Deploy the Model

The deploy model section explains how to create an endpoint and deploy the trained model using the PyTorchModel class. It includes instructions for setting up the necessary configurations and deploying the model to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.

## Test the Model

The test model section demonstrates how to send sample input data to the deployed endpoint and obtain predictions on the sentiment of the reviews. It provides an example code snippet for testing the model.
