# Feature-Transformation-using-Amazon-SageMaker

This project takes raw Women's Clothing Reviews data and prepares it to train a BERT-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. The model classifies customer reviews into positive (1), neutral (0), and negative (-1) sentiment. The original review text is converted into machine-readable features used by BERT using Amazon SageMaker.
